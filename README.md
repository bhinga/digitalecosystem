# Welcome to the Digital Ecosystem workshop repository. 

This repo contains materials and a wiki that will help walk you through how to set up a simple digital ecosystem using software and data that is freely and (mostly) readily available. 

One of the underlying motivations for this workshop is to provide a model for how to easily create a digital map that incorporates point data with raster data (historical maps). 
--------------
You will need at least 3 accounts to participate in this workshop.

* CARTO - Mapping and spatial analysis tool.
* GitHub - A software development platform where you can build, collaborate, and share projects.
* MapBox - Open source mapping platform that can help you host maps among many other features.

GitHub now offers a Student Developer Pack for current students with valid institution email accounts. 
Please go here and sign up for a pack BEFORE the workshop:

* GitHub Student Developer Pack - https://education.github.com/pack/join
* MapBox - https://www.mapbox.com/signup/

In the case you do not get your Student Developer Pack in time for the workshop, sign up for a 30 day trial to CARTO and get a GitHub and MapBox account separately. There will be no problem doing the workshop with the trial version of CARTO!

* Carto - https://carto.com/signup/

For most digital projects you will have an assortment of materials that you will then want to visualize on a map or some other method. For this example project we want to learn more about the history of Los Angeles through the lens of the GreenBook. We will use the following data to build out our project:

*a dataset created by pulling data from the GreenBook
*georeferenced historical maps of Los Angeles
*census data
*Los Angeles Times neighborhood boundary data
*Historical HOLC (Insurance map) boundary and rating data

Using these datasets we will create a digital project that will let us explore Los Angeles and provide opportunities for meaningful engagement, interpretation, discovery, and critical thinking.

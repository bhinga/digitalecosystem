# Welcome to the Digital Ecosystem workshop repository. 

This repo contains materials and a wiki that will help walk you through how to set up a simple digital ecosystem using software and data that is freely and (mostly) readily available. 

One of the underlying motivations for this workshop is to provide a model for how to easily create a digital map that incorporates point data with raster data (historical maps). 

You will need at least 3 accounts to participate in this workshop.

* CARTO - Mapping and spatial analysis tool.
* GitHub - A software development platform where you can build, collaborate, and share projects.
* MapBox - Open source mapping platform that can help you host maps among many other features.

GitHub now offers a Student Developer Pack for current students with valid institution email accounts. 
Please go here and sign up for a pack BEFORE the workshop:

* GitHub Student Developer Pack - https://education.github.com/pack/join
* MapBox - https://www.mapbox.com/signup/

In the case you do not get your Student Developer Pack in time for the workshop, sign up for a 30 day trial to CARTO and get a GitHub and MapBox account separately. There will be no problem doing the workshop with the trial version of CARTO!
